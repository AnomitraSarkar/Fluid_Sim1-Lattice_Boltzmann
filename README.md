# Fluid_Sim1-Lattice_Boltzmann
Fluid Simulation Series Part 1
The Lattice Boltzmann Methodolgy to easily simulate a fluid motion around a cylinder

HOW TO RUN?

1. Run the main file on any setting mode (initial run to understand the behavious: Default)
2. A Real Time plot will be made for the given timestep
3. After a certain timestep the output image are saved as "LatticeBoltzmann.png" file

Check out the already output pictures to lookup on the expected outputs on different map settings.

*Note: The no of particles = (x-resolution) x (y-resolution) is directly propotional to (Error) + (Latency) in the predicted model.
